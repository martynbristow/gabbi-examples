# HTTP Testing with Gabbi by Example

[Gabbi](http://gabbi.readthedocs.org) is a simple HTTP testing framework developed in Python, with tests written as simple YAML file, these tests can be extended with Python setUp and tearDown methods.

I'm developing a Web Application, with a series of pages presenting data and reports, and a simple REST API.
I needed to develop a set of functional end-to-end tests and learned about gabbi from a colleague, but the documentation is sparese, so I have written a tutorial and some examples.

I hope they are of use to you, if I've missed something then please let me know, or submit a pull request.
